# Broadcom Cleanup Scripts
This repository houses sample scripts for use cases involving Broadcom Products.

# Using
Sample scripts for each product are located in the directory that shares its name. For example, Cleanup samples are in the subsequent child directories. If you cannot find a particular use case, [please open an issue](https://github.com/BroadcomMFD/broadcom-product-scripts/issues/new).

# Folders
ETCL - Cleanup Interactive - this allows you to interactively create Cleanup Reports, placing Cleanup reports into dynamically named temporary dataset, placing the user into edit move, allow PF7/8 scrolling and searching.  Eliminate some batch job processing just to review a particular Cleanup report while working to clean up entitlements, all without submitting JCL. Will work with ACF2, TSS and RACF managed systems with the Broadcom CLEANUP solution.

The techdocs reference for the Broadcom CLEANUP solution can be found here: [CLEANUP Techdocs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/ca-mainframe-software/security/ca-cleanup/12-1.html)
