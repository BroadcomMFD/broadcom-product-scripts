# Broadcom TSS RF REXX Script
RF REXX provides the capability to quickly issue the TSS REFRESH(acid)JOBNAME(*) command to refresh the security record of an ACID with less typing. 

The challenge:  Less typing can allow for greater efficiency and free up time for other cybersecurity requirements.  

# Using
