Sample scripts for each product are located in the directory that shares its name. For example, TSS samples are in the subsequent child directories. If you cannot find a particular use case, [please open an issue](https://github.com/BroadcomMFD/broadcom-product-scripts/issues/new).

# Folders

Additionally, it builds all the TSS commands to remove those STC entries, places the output into a temp dataset, it will place you into ISPF edit mode where you can copy batch TSS JCL and submit to cleanup those entries.
