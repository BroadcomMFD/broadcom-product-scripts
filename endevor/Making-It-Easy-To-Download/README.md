# How to make it easy on yourself to download from this site


Use MOVEOUT
##  MOVEOUT


To reduce the number of uploads required to implement tools on this site, many of them come with an .moveout extension. These files on GitHub logically contain multiple members that you need. Upload the file with the .moveout extension into a member of a PDS or PDS/E on your mainframe. Then, execute the MOVEOUT edit macro on the uploaded member and multiple members will be created for you. It is not necessary for you to upload each member separately.
