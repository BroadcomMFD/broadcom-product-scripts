# Miscellaneous-items

These are other miscellaneous Endevor tools

## ANL#* and BTCHEDIT

These items offer a Rexx Edit macro alternative to using the Endevor Inventory Analyzer. Advantages this Rexx version has:

- The Edit macro ANL#VIEW can be tested on individual members of source. While viewing a member, enter ANL#VIEW on the command line.
- Some conditions can be easier handled. For example, the analysis might produce Emdevor SCL and OPTIONS content

## FINDLOOP and FINDWRD1

Together these can be used with Batch Administration SCL to expose complete statements - from 'DEFINE' to '.' 

## JCLCOMMT

This edit macro can be executed on Endevor processors, JCL, PROCs and some Skeletons. While editing one of these in Quick-Edit and enter JCLCOMMT on the command line. Lines containing an EXEC statement are then commented.

## PTBROWSE and PTEDIT

While editing a processor (or JCL) where a dataset name is found, enter the name of either of these to Browse or Edit the dataset.
