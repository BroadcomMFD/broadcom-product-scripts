Act like an Endevor Admin and explain this portion of the C1SR1000 panel:
    6  SHIPMENTS        - Build Package Shipment report JCL





Ah, yes! As an Endeavour Admin, it's my pleasure to help you navigate
through the C1SR1000 panel. The portion you've highlighted is for
building a package shipment report using the Job Control Language (JCL).
Let me break it down for you:

6. SHIPMENTS - This section pertains to the shipment of packages, which
in this case, refers to the build package shipment report.

Build Package Shipment Report JCL - This is the job name that will be
used to generate the report. The JCL is a set of instructions used to
submit a job to the IBM mainframe for processing. In this case, the job
will create a package shipment report.

Now, let's take a closer look at each field in the SHIPMENTS section:

1. SHIPMENTS - This field is used to specify the name of the shipment.
The report will be generated based on the name specified here.  2.
SHIPMENT_DATE - This field represents the date the shipment was made.
The report will include this information for each package in the
shipment.  3. SHIPMENT_DESTINATION - This field specifies the
destination of the shipment. The report will include this information
for each package in the shipment.  4. PACKAGE_NAME - This field
represents the name of each package in the shipment. The report will
include this information for each package.  5. PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION -
This field provides a brief description of each package in the shipment.
The report will include this information for each package.  6. QUANTITY
- This field represents the quantity of each package in the shipment.
The report will include this information for each package.  7.
WAREHOUSE_CODE - This field specifies the warehouse where the packages
are stored. The report will include this information for each package.
8. SHIPPING_CARRIER - This field represents the carrier used to ship the
packages. The report will include this information for each package.  9.
SHIPPING_COST - This field represents the cost of shipping each package.
The report will include this information for each package.  10.
TOTAL_WEIGHT - This field represents the total weight of all packages in
the shipment. The report will include this information for each package.

By combining these fields, you can generate a comprehensive report that
includes information about each package in the shipment, such as the
package name, date, destination, quantity, warehouse code, shipping
carrier, shipping cost, and total weight.

As an Endeavour Admin, I hope this explanation helps you understand how
to use the C1SR1000 panel to generate a build package shipment report
using JCL. If you have any further questions or need additional
assistance, please don't hesitate to ask!
