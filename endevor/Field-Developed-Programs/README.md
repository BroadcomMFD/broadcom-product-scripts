# Field-Developed-Programs

"Field Developed Program" (FDP) is a term used to refer to programs that were created to address specific needs or requirements of customers. These were constructed by your trusted Broadcom Services team and have been implemented at multiple Endevor customer sites.
They are tested, secure and available for your use.

## New to GitHub ? ## 

Do you just want to copy and upload the code? 

Here is a simple procedure you can use. Start from [GitHub](https://github.com/BroadcomMFD/broadcom-product-scripts) and find the green box containing the text **'<> Code'**.  Choose one of the options that appears. If you select the **Download ZIP** option, then GitHub will create a zip file that you can extract to your desktop, and use TSO SEND to upload to a mainframe.  

## ACM-build-without-Generates

Since 2005 [this FDP](ACM-build-without-Generates) has been used at sites that had not built their Automated Configuration Manager data. Generating elements at the time of conversion remains the best approach, but if the opportunity was missed this FDP can catch things up quickly and without risk.

## API-Assembler-Examples

[Assembler API programs](API-Assembler-Examples) are included in several of the other FDP entries. They provide services not offered by the CSV utility or are being used for better performance. 

## Exit-Examples

Many of [these exit examples](Exit-Examples) are COBOL exit stubs that depend on REXX subroutines for the 'real' work.
The Stub is virtually static, and the REXX is able to operate on variables as defined as COBOL variables in Endevor's techdocs. (Dash characters in the COBOL documentation are replaced by underscores in REXX).

## ISPF tools for Quick-Edit and Endevor

This [repository](ISPF-tools-for-Quick-Edit-and-Endevor) contains a collection of tools that are dependent upon on IBM's ISPF, and available only to Quick-Edit and Endevor mainframe users. Since 2004, these tools increase the users productivity level, and in some cases deliver an experience closer to that given by the use of VS Code.

## Miscellaneous-items

This is a [collection of tips and tricks](Miscellaneous-items) that lighten the workloads for Endevor administrators.

## Multi-Package-Reporting-and-Validations

[This sample repository](Multi-Package-Reporting-and-Validations) provides solutions for the reporting of input component omissions, and package relationships for multiple Endevor packages that must be evaluated together.

## Package-Automation

Since the year 2006 a number of Endevor sites have automated their package executions and shipments using [this FDP](Package-Automation).

## Post-Ship-Scripts-for-Shipping-Endevor-to-Endevor

[These items](Post-Ship-Scripts-for-Shipping-Endevor-to-Endevor) demonstrate features of Post-Ship-Scripts. At the same time they show how to logically extend an Endevor life cycle from one Lpar to another.

## Processor-Tools-and-Processor-Snippets

This [collection](Processor-Tools-and-Processor-Snippets) contains widely-used objects and examples  for Endevor processors.

## Table-Tool-Examples

A [collection](Field-Developed-Programs/Table-Tool-Examples) of JCL and processor members that demonstrate the use of Table Tool. Many of the objects in this folder were produced as a result of requests from the [Endevor Community website](https://community.broadcom.com/home).
