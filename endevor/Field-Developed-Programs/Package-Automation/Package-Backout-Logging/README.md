# Package Backout/Backin Logging

This folder contains items you can use to write a log for all packaged BackedIn or BackOut members. 

When a Package or selected elements are Backout or BackedIn, a log is written to contain a record of members affected.






It contains a little overlap with items in the [ServiceNow](https://github.com/BroadcomMFD/broadcom-product-scripts/tree/main/endevor/ServiceNow-Interface) folder.
