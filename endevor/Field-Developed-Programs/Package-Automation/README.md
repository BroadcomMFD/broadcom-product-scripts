# Package-Automation

This collection provides two opportunities to introduce automation for package actions:

  - Automate Package Executions as soon as the package status changes to "APPROVED", and the time falls within the Execution window
  - Automate Package Shipments as soon as the package status changes to "EXECUTED", and your "Rules" of package shipments indicate that the package should be Shipped.

If both are included then for example, the final approval given to a package would kick off an immediate package execution, and when completed the submissions of package shipments to 3 destinations would immediately follow.

Package Automation has been around for many years, and can run on any release of Endevor. 
Whether a package action is performed manually, by a zowe command, a sweep job, the Endevor web interface, or any other means, the Package Automation follow-up actions remain the same.

## Package Automation on Multiple Endevor images

Some Endevor administrators have responsibility for multiple Endevor images, where details like job cardÂ information and dataaset names differ from one to the next. To accommodate multiple images, the members listed below are provided to contain image-specific detail and to allow the remainder of the items to remain unchanged.

On each Lpar where portions of this collection will run:

 - Place the REXX items into a new or existing library of your choice. 
 - Enter the name the library into the Exit program you choose
     - C1UEXT07 for Automated Executions and Shipments 
     - C1UEXSHP for Automated Shipments only 
 - The WHEREIAM.rex member is not a part of the configuration, 
 but is intended to help identify names you should use as @site member names. 
 Execute the WHEREIAM.rex (as is) to determine the new name to give to the member currently named @site. 
 Then tailor the content to reflect values for the Lpar. 

    For example, if you intend to execute the collection on Lpars named SYS1 and SYS7, 
  then WHEREIAM.rex will instruct you to create members @SYS1 and @SYS7 respectively. 
  The names you use for the Rules and Trigger files must entered into the @SYS1 and @SYS7 members. 
  Additionally the names of the libraries and members you use as "MODELS" must be entered.

## Automate Package Executions

 When an action changes the package Status value to "APPROVED", either a CAST or REVIEW action was performed. The next step for the package is to EXECUTE the package, but normally a delay postpones the execution until an EXECUTE action is requested. At sites where a "Sweep" job is used, the execution may wait minutes or hours until the next "Sweep" job runs. Then the package execution will be submitted concurrently with executions of other packages that were also waiting. Package Automation spreads out the submissions of package executions and eliminates the waiting. It submits a package execution as soon as the package Status is APPROVED. Since the year 2005, many Endevor sites have been using this feature of Package Automation.

 Members that contribute to this feature include:
   - C1UEXT07.cob
   - PKGEEXEC.tbl
   - PKGEXECT.rex
   - PKG#MODL.skl

If you want to automate Executions only and to turn off the Automated Shipment feature, then comment or delete these SETUP options within C1UEXT07:
  - PECB-AFTER-EXEC 
  - PECB-REQ-ELEMENT-ACTION-BIBO
  - PECB-AFTER-BACKOUT 
  - PECB-AFTER-BACKIN 


## Automate Package Shipments

When a package completes its Execution, the next step for the package might be one or more package shipments. This second feature of Package Automation automatically submits zero to many package shipments, based on the package content, or the package name. No longer is the manual use of panel actions required.

Immediately after a package Execution, the content of the package is compared with a table of "Rules". The comparison prepares zero to many destinations and shipments to be submitted immediately or scheduled for a later time. 

The only requirement is that manual package shipments be already configured.  

### Items for Automated Shipping

Most items for this feature require no changes during installation. Not every item in this collection is necessary at your site. Some items are available as choices for what works best for you. For example:

 - The C1UEXT07 program performs both Automated functions - Executions and Shipments. In case you want to automate shipping only, there are two additional exit programs within the collection named C1UEXSHP. However, you need only one of them. One is written in assembler and the other in COBOL. Choose the one that works best for you. If for example, your Endevor run time libraries are not PDS-E or you have not yet migrated to latest version of COBOL, you may elect to use the assembler version.

 - These routines were originally constructed prior to the availability of Endevor's CSV utility. Several of the REXX routines contain both API sections and CSV sections. If you do not use any of the API sections, then the corresponding assembler API programs are not necessary for you.
 
 - Three package shipping "MODELS" are provided in this collection as examples for your models. After submitting and capturing each unique kind of your own package shipment job(s), you can tailor them using the models as a guide.

### Installation steps for Automated Shipping

On each Lpar where this collection will run:

1. Place all the REXX items into a new or existing library of your choice. 
2. Determine which version of the exit you want to run. In the source code of your choice, enter the name of the REXX library you selected in step 1. You may also choose to install the program with the default package exit name, C1UEXT07.
3. Tailor a Rules file to reflect your choices for package content and shipment destinations. Record the Rules file dataset name in the renamed @site member. By default package shipments are submitted immediately after a package execution. You may choose to force delays in package shipments by coding values in the Date and Time fields. If you do, then a SWEEP job will be responsible for submitting delayed package shipments. Schedule the SWEEP job to run on a frequency that is appropriate for you. If you already have a SWEEP job for executing packages, you may need only the last step from the example SWEEPJOB member to initiate package shipments.
4. Upload (or copy) the Trigger file as a sequential file, and record the name in the renamed @site member. Only the heading on each Trigger file is necessary.
5. From the JCL submitted for your manual shipments, create a "MODEL" for each unique kind or shipment. For example you may have local shipments and remote XCOM shipments.
6. Find Assembler API program source, APIALSUM for example, in the **API-Assembler-Examples** folder.

The COBOL and Assembler modules you select to use, must be generated using your Endevor release CSIQOPTN and CSIQLOAD libraries as input, and typically output to your CSIQAUTU library.
