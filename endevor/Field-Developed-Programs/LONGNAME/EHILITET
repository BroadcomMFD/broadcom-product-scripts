+   You can enable or disable Endevor message highlighting using the^EHIlite    
+   command.  If enabled, messages are highlighted according to severity;       
+  White +-  Severe messages (Messages ending in 'S')                          
+  Red   +-  Error messages                                                    
+  Pink  +-  Caution messages                                                  
+  Yellow+-  Warning messages                                                  
+  Green +-  Notification messages                                             
+  Blue  +-  Information messages                                              
+                                                                               
+   Note: in VIEW mode BLUE and GREEN are reversed.                             
+                                                                               
^*Message Summary                                                               
+   When^VIEW+mode is used to display Endevor messages the command              
+  ^EndvHiSc+(Endevor Hilite-Scan) can be used to scan the entire               
+   message file and build a summary of messages at the bottom found            
+   along with the line numbers where the message was found and the first       
+   message text.  You can optionally use the^IMACRO ENDVHISC+command           
+   to allow this command to run every time you open files of this              
+   type (determined by the final qualifier).                                   
+                                                                               
^*Highlight Flower-Box                                                          
+   If enabled, Endevor will hilite the contents of^"flower boxes"+(lines       
+   that start with "** ") inTurquoise.+Normally this will make Endevor        
+   location information standout, but it might cause some non-flower           
+   box lines to be highlighted incorectly, If this is an issue use the         
+  ^EHIlite+command to turn disable it.                                         
+                                                                               
^*Scroll Bar                                                                    
+   As you navigate through a report file, Endevor Hilite will keep track     +
+   of where messages were found and build a quick reference bar using        +
+   reverse video blocks along the right side of the data.  ^As shown here==> +
+   In small files the bar colours will have a one-to-one correspondence      +
+   to the data lines.  If the file is larger, then the bar will be           +
+   compressed relative to the file size and this compression may be          +
+   adjusted as you scroll within the file. By positioning the cursor in      +
+   the scroll bar area, and pressing^ENTER+you can navigate to the           +
+   represented area of the file.  However, with very large files this will   +
+   become less accurate as each "block" will start to represent more         +
+   than a page of data.  Each block will change colour to represent the      +
+   highest severity in the corresponding section of the file, for            +
+   example, theRED+blocks in the sample on the left indicate an error       +
+   message near the top and bottom of the file. White is used to mark        +
+   the current page, in this case, about half way down the file.             +
+                                                                               
+   Note: The Scroll Bar is disabled by default, but you can enable it          
+   using the^EHIlite+command.                                                  
+                                                                               
^*View/Edit Highlighting                                                        
+   Endevor HiLite can optionally be enabled when in VIEW or EDIT modes         
+   but note, if enabled, it may conflict with normal ISPF highlighting and     
+   the results may be unpredictable.  Turning off ISPF highlighting using      
+   the^HILITE OFF+command will enable highlighting of just the messages.       
+                                                                               
^*Toggle Browse/View                                                            
+   The new^EVEdit+command can be used to switch from^Browse+mode to^VIEW+      
+   more or vice versa.  When switching to^VIEW+mode it will also enable        
+   the scan^(EndvHiSc)+to build the Message Summary automatically.             
+                                                                               
^*Global Support                                                                
+   Because the panels currently used for Browsing/Viewing/Editing messages     
+   could also be used in normal ISPF Edit/Browse, Endevor highlighting is      
+   disabled by default when not in Endevor (applid CTLI) but if you wish,      
+   you can override this behavior and enable Endevor Hilite outside Endevor    
+   for example when Browsing or Editing Endevor logs using^SysView+or^SDSF.+   
+                                                                               
^*Point-n-Shoot                                                                 
+   If your emulator supoorts it, you can use the mouse to double click on      
+   either the scroll bar, or a line number in the^Message Summary+to jump      
+   to the corresponding location in the file.  Alternatively, just move the    
+   cursor to these locations and press^ENTER.+                                 
+                                                                               
^*Quick Edit Compiler messages                                                  
+   If your Endevor Administrator has enabled support for this feature (with    
+   processor and initial edit macro changes) this option will toggle how       
+   Quick Edit will display compiler error messages the next time you edit      
+   an element where the processor detected(and saved) compiler error messages. 
+   The goal is to have compiler error messages inserted as=NOTE=+and==MSG>+  
+   lines in the appropriate location while editing the source, making it easy  
+   to identify and correct compiler errors without having to refer back to the 
+   listing.                                                                    
+                                                                               
+

+   While colour highlighting might not make sense in batch mode, support       
+   for a message summary^(C1MSGS3)+could be enabled to generate an extra       
+   Messages file after an Endevor step if it gets a non-zero return code.
