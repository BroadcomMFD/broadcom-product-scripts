+   A list of up to 8 project locations are stored and can be edited by         
+   simply over-typing the project location field to specify the Environment,   
+   System, SubSystem, Type, Element, Search Map, First Found, CCID and         
+   Comment, with each value delimited by '\'.                                  
+                                                                               
+   If the location field is not big enough to fit ALL the data you'd like      
+   to save you can use^left/right+scrolling and/or the^EXPAND+command          
+

+   In normal use, Endevor will "remember" the previous locations visited       
+   and mark the most recent one with a^>>>+flag, the previous one with^>>+     
+   and the entry before that with^>+flag.  Prior locations will be stored      
+   as space permits untill all locations are filled, at which point the        
+   oldest entry will be dropped.                                               
+   Note: When saving locations, if that location is already in the list        
+   this ripple down will stop at that point so as to avoid filling the         
+   history with duplicates.                                                    
+                                                                               
^*Favourite Locations                                                           
+   You can use the Project Manager to "MARK" any location as a favourite       
+   my placing a '/' in the Fav column. which will cause it to float to         
+   the top and NOT be rolled off as new entries are added.                     
+                                                                               
^*Naming Favourites                                                             
+   You can also add a 'Friendly' name to any favourite to make it easy         
+   to identify when inspecting from the project list.                          
+                                                                               
^*Delete Locations                                                              
+   To delete a saved location, simply erase the location information           
+   data by pressing EOF in that field.                                         
+                                                                               
^*Save/Restore Options                                                          
+   Whether the CCID, Comment, Search Map,and First Found, options are          
+   saved is controlled by setting the appropriate option to '/' to enable      
+   it for that field.  You can use this to ensure that the appropriate         
+   values are restored on a Project by Project basis.  You can of course       
+   simply overtype the corresponding values in the location fields             
+                                                                               
^*Confirm/Jump Option                                                           
+   When you select a new project the corresponing Environment, System,         
+   SubSystem, etc. are recalled but by default you still have to press         
+  ^ENTER+to confirm the selection.  If you set this option to '2' you are      
+   requesting an immediate JUMP to the selected location as if you had         
+   pressed Enter.                                                              
+   Note: If you select a new project from an element selection list            
+   you will always be 'jumped' to that location                                
+  ^Hint:+When setting the immediate jump option, but wildcarding on the        
+   too many fields results in the^"are you sure"+prompt use^"%*"_as the        
+   element name.
