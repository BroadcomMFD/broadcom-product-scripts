^*Quick Edit Batch Actions Update                                               
+   With PTF SO12079 applied there were some minor changes to panels/           
+   clists included for WideScreen support - this bundle V63 includes           
+   compatibility for this level.                                               
+                                                                               
^*Quick Edit Batch Actions+(CD180101)                                           
+   With PTFs SO11288/1901 applied, Quick Edit supports Queueing multiple       
+   actions in batch instead of submitting each request as a single job.        
+   Bundle version 62 includes compatibility in the LongName utility.           
+                                                                               
^*LockPackage                                                                   
+   With PTFs SO08738/8734 applied, Quick Edit now allows the LockPackage       
+   field to be scrolled left/right and/or Expanded.  Bundle version 61         
+   provides compatible support for the LongName utility.                       
+

+   With PTFs SO07890 and SO07891 applied, The LongName utility no longer       
+   needs to provide the COMPELM Rexx as this is now included in the base       
+   product.  The COPYELM and COMPELM commands now support selection of         
+   versions/levels and the ability to Browse the element, view the History,    
+   Changes and Master information.                                             
+                                                                               
^*V18.0.12 GA                                                                   
+   Endevor V18.0.12 (or GA Complete) included many changes, including          
+   dynamic panels, and later extended column support in Quick Edit.            
+   As a result there is less need to use the LongName utility per se.          
+   However, you may still wish to use the panel overrides to Enhance the       
+   standard Endevor with the prototype features (like click-to-sort on         
+   the QuickEdit Column headings or to re-arrange the column headings to       
+   give you access to fields) not available in the base product.               
+                                                                               
^*Deploy to Test                                                                
+   Access the^DT+option+to deploy sandbox elements to a test environment       
+   e.g.^CICS, IMS+or^DB2+locations. From any Quick/Edit element Selection      
+   list, simply use the "DT" primary command (or access it from                
+   the ActionBar drop-down menu under Endevor, Deploy to Test.  The dialog     
+   will use the current sandbox elements to build a package of elements to be  
+   deployed. Enter (or click on) the Target Test environment from the list,    
+   and press Enter to build, cast, validate and execute the package.           
+   Optionally you can review, (select/unselect) individual elements            
+   to be deployed by setting the "Select Elements" option.                     
+                                                                               
^*Endevor Hilite                                                                
+   Now when you Browse or Edit Endevor messages they should be highlighted     
+   according to message severity.  Error messages will be flagged as RED,      
+   Warning messages in YELLOW etc.  This makes it much easier to find the      
+   root cause when there are muptiple errors.  You can control                 
+   hilighting appearance with the new^EHIlite+command.                         
+                                                                               
+   In addition there is a new command^EVEdit+that allows you to switch         
+   between^VIEW, EDIT+and^BROWSE+modes, and to invoke the^ENDVHISC+iMacro.     
+                                                                               
+   To use EHIlite with^Sysview+or^SDSF+use the^ESYSview+or^ESDsf+commands      
+   from within Endevor.  In Edit views (ED or SE) you can use the^ENDVHISC+    
+   command to scan the file and insert a message summary, or set this as       
+   the initial macro (IMacro) so it happens automatically.                     
+                                                                               
^*Endevor C1MSGS3                                                               
+   An often requested feature (C1MSGS3) or the abiltiy to show a summary       
+   of important messages from a batch job and therefore make it easier to      
+   find the real error is now included.  Users can enable the feature on       
+   a personal basis by copy/pasting the following snippet as "Additional JCL"  
+   when submitting batch requests, and/or the Endevor admin can add them to    
+   the appropriate skeletons/batch jobs as needed.  The feature works by       
+   saving a copy of the C1MSGS1 and C1MSGS2 to a temporary file, and then      
+   invoking a rexx routine to format them if there are any error messages.     
+

+   Gain complete control over the look and feel of the Endevor screens.

+   toggle-able options in a way that is more consistent across all ISPF        
+   applications.  You can also use the CUAATTR command to tailor the colour    
+   and high-lighting of any CUA field, for example to enable REVERSE video     
+   on point-n-shoot fields.

+   routine with the same name as the FDP site customisation function           
+  ^(WHEREAMI).+ To avoid problems, this function is renamed as^WHERE@M1.+

^*Code Page 285 & Endevor v18 compatibility                                     
+   For sites that run with non-English code pages, some symbols used on        
+   panels may not display correctly (for example square brackets, pound or     
+   hash sign etc.) to avoid problems the LongName utility will use more        
+   common/generic symbols such as the regular brackets^(+&&^)+instead.         
+

+   values are saved and restored when you change Projects.                     
+                                                                               
^*Submit Sample User Routine                                                    
+   New Sample User Routine (USRRTNUS) can be used to^SUBMIT+the selected       
+   element as a job for processing.  This sample routine, which performs       
+   an API based^RETRIEVE,+followed by regular^TSO Submit^can be used as a      
+   basis for any number of custom commands that require a local copy of        
+   an element to work with - please add and share your ideas on                
+   http://communities.ca.com                                                   
+                                                                               
^*View and Edit Profile                                                         
+   LongName will now select a profile based on the element type whenever       
+  ^View+or^Edit+is invoked - this will ensure that your prefered settings      
+   are "sticky" and won't change from session to session.  If you need to      
+   change this behavior you can override it in the Initial edit macro          
+   (LONGIMAC)                                                                  
+                                                                               
^*View and Edit ASCII or UTF8                                                   
+   LongName now allows both Edit and View^ASCII+or^UTF-8+files using the       
+  ^EA+and^VA+(ASCII) and^EU+and^VU+(UTF-8) commands respectivly.  When the     
+   ASCII or UTF-8 options are in effect , the element is retrieved to a        
+   temporary path instead of a temporary file before the Editor is             
+   invoked.                                                                    
+                                                                               
^*Preserve VB Record Length                                                     
+   LongName now supports the Preserve VB record length edit option rather      
+   than having to specify^PRESERVE ON/OFF+after starting Edit.  If 'Y' is      
+   specified the trailing spaces of any record in a variable record edit       
+   session will be preserved. If N is specified the trailing spaces will       
+   be removed.                                                                 
+                                                                               
^*Dynamic Element Length/Record Format                                          
+   LongName now will now query Endevor to determine the appropriate record     
+   length and record format before invoking Edit/View on an element.  This     
+   can still be overridden (if required) on a TYPE basis by customizing the    
+   LongName defaults.                                                          
+                                                                               
^*View CSV Data in Column format (COLMEYES)                                     
+   An Edit macro (COLMEYES) is provided to convert standard CSV data into      
+   a more easily read "columnar" format - just Edit or view a CSV file and     
+   issue the^COLMEYES+command.                                                 
+                                                                               
^*Route by Type Support                                                         
+   LongName now sets a variable (EMULTYPS) which can be used by the            
+   skeleton which will contain a list of all TYPEs being processed in the      
+   current job.  This can be used to determine where the job should be         
+   Executed, for example processing all C or COBOL compiles on spefic          
+   LPARS by insertive/validating the SYSAFF or SCHENV attributes.              
+                                                                               
^*SnapMon Job Type Support                                                      
+   SnapMon now uses a more reliable method to determine Job type and now       
+   shows a breakdown of Endevor workload by Job type; TSO, JOB, STC, Other.    
+   Additionally, if you use Endevor distributed workload, jobs that are        
+   waiting for remote step execution will be highlighted.                      
+                                                                               
^*Support for ENUXSITE                                                          
+   If your site uses the Endevor initialisation exit (ENUXSITE) to control     
+   loading of specific Endevor tables, this will now work with LongName too.   
+                                                                               
^*Additional Columns                                                            
+   LongName now provides addidional columns in the selection list to           
+   show the Stage Number, Stage Name and Logical Stage Number.  These          
+   new fields will be hidden by default (width=0) but you can enable them      
+   using the ECOLs command.                                                    
+   Note: If you have already modified your default columns use the RESET       
+   command to pull in the updated defaults.                                    
+                                                                               
^*Endevor Duplicates Filter (EDUPs)                                             
+   Like the^EONLY+and the^EFind+commands, that act to filter the element       
+   selection list, there is a new command^EDUPs+which you can use to show      
+  ^Duplicates+(same element name in multiple locations) or^Unique elements     
+   (where the element name is found in only one location).                     
+                                                                               
+   The filter is controlled by the parametrs passed:                           
^     =  +To show all duplicates, except those up the map                       
^     &P +To show all duplicates, including those up the map                    
^     -  +To show only the unique elements                                      
+                                                                               
+   Enter^EDUPs+again,without any parameters, to restore the prior selection    
+   list.                                                                       
+                                                                               
+   Note:^EDUPs+works only with the "visible" selection list so the current     
+   settings for Search Map, and Return First Found and any inventory filters   
+   also apply.                                                                 
+                                                                               
^*Additional ActionBar options                                                  
+   LongName now provides drop down menu support for QuickEdit, Packages        
+   and the Endevor Activity moniter(SNAPMON) from the Action bar.              
+   However you are still limited to running only one of each application       
+   in a single split screen. ^LongName+now supports this too.                  
+   In addition there is now an^Endevor Activity+option in the Action Bar       
+   under the Endevor item.                                                     
+                                                                               
^*Added Endevor Snapshot Monitor                                                
+   The Endevor^SnapMon+tool provides a simple way for Administrators to        
+   check on Endevor activity for an entire LPAR.  It works using the           
+   'IS ACTIVE IN SCREEN' Enqueues that Endevor and it's options use            
+   to detect being already active. ^LongName+now supports this too.            
+   In addition there is now an^Endevor Activity+option in the Action Bar       
+   under the Endevor item.                                                     
+                                                                               
^*Support Endevor V18 Spaces in Ele Names                                       
+   Endevor v18 allows spaces in element names (RO85779) but has new SCL        
+   syntax to ensure spaces are preserved when continued over multiple          
+   lines by wrapping each "chunk" with quotes and adding a comma to            
+   indicate a continued string. ^LongName+now supports this too.               
+                                                                               
^   Note:+Because of this, now to specify^MULTIPLE+element names in the         
+   selection criteria, you must separate them with^Commas,+for example;        
+                                                                               
+      ELEMENT:                                                                 
+   ^>+ABC*, OneEle, Another Element With Spaces, z*                            
+                                                                               
^*Sample StartFDP Menu                                                          
+   There is now a sample startup command^STARTFDP+which will perform the       
+   required^LIBDEFs+to enable support for the Field Developed Program          
+   proto-type enhancements.  Use this as a method of invoking Endevor,         
+   QuickEdit, LongName, PDM etc. with support for WideScreen, Esrchfor etc.    
+                                                                               
^*Element Locked Status                                                         
+   Element selection lists now include the^Locked Status+of an element         
+   so you can see Elements that are locked, the package (Current Package)      
+   and the Locked Date and Time.  If you attempt to edit an element that       
+   is Locked a warning message is shown with details of it's locked status     
+   The^Apply Filter+option is also enhanced to allow filtering the element     
+   selection list to only include Locked elements.                             
+  ^Note:+If you can't see the Locked Element details, you may need to reset    
+   your column settings using the ECols command(ECols;RESET)                   
+                                                                               
^*Edit Line Command Table Support                                               
+   The Line Command Table field on the LongName entry panel gives you          
+   the opportunity to define a set of user line commands that you can          
+   use during the edit or view requests.                                       
+                                                                               
^*Stage Filter                                                                  
+   The LongName utility now supports a^Stage Filter+to allow you to specify    
+   exactly which stage(s) you want to appear in the element selection list.    
+   By default, the LongName utility operates like QuickEdit showing all        
+   elements in the selected ENVIRONMENT (i.e. both stage 1 and 2) so even if   
+   Build Using Map is set to No, you may see elements at more than one stage.  
+   A stage filter list has been added to the Filter options panel to allow you 
+   to specify one (or more) stage IDs to be listed (filtering out all others), 
+   or this field can be left blank to request all stages.  This option can be  
+   combined with a Search up the map to return specific satages only.          
+   Alternatively you can change the^Build Using Map+option to specify a value  
+   of^"1"+or^"2"+to restrict the list to elements to stage number 1 or 2 only. 
+                                                                               
^*Package Action Support                                                        
+   The LongName utility now supports a action processing option of^Package.    
+   Typically used after using^'Append'+to queue up multiple requests, the      
+  ^'Package'+action will then prompt the user for a Package name and           
+   Description (with a default Package name that can be generated by rules     
+   that the user selects - for example to create a Package name using the      
+   Target Stage ID, followed by a uniqe data/time based string.  In addition   
+   the user may select to automatically, cast/validate/execute the Package.    
+   Note: If you have saved pending requests and you change your mind you       
+   can use the^CANCEL+command to clear the current and all pending requests.   
+                                                                               
^*PkgEleS Primary Command                                                       
+   Use the^PKGeles+command to create a Package based on the elements in the    
+  ^current selection list,+and to optionally^Cast/Validate/Execute it in a     
+   submitted job.  Use search filters,^EFind,+or^EOnly+to exclude elements     
+   you don't want in your Package or if you prefer, set the^'Use Pick-list'    
+   option to 'Y'to bring up an extra prompt panel where you can ^Select/       
+  ^Unselect+elements from a list before you submit the request.                
+   The Package name is generated automatically, based on the date/time,        
+   but may be overridden if required.  CCID and Comment default to the         
+   current dialog values.                                                      
+   Note: The generated Package may also contain long name Elements.            
+                                                                               
^*Multiple SubSystem Name Masks                                                 
+   You are no longer restricted to entering a Single SubSystem name when       
+   starting the utility, simply enter multiple names or patterns separated     
+   by space or comma - for example;^ESCM* SIQ000%9 +to show elements matching  
+   either SubSystem pattern.  This is especially useful if you use^Sandboxs    
+   for parallel development.  However if you are creating an element then      
+   you can only specify a single SubSystem and it may not be wild carded.      
+   Note: Like the element name field, you use the^EXPAND+or^LEFT/RIGHT+        
+   scrolling to view/enter more subsystems.                                    
+                                                                               
^*C1MSGSA/C1MSGSA                                                               
+   Sometimes you need both^C1MSGSA+and^C1MSGS1+to diagnose a problem with      
+   an API or CSV request.  Now the C1MSGSA+file is appended to C1MSGS1 so      
+   that you can see them all messages in a single place.                       
+   Note: Additionally temp files are now always deleted on exit.               
+                                                                               
^*Submit Symbols(Extended support)                                              
+   Now when you submit a job for batch you can use regular Endevor             
+   symbols name in the job card(s) and have them expanded when you             
+   submit the job.  Expansion is controled by an option (Y/N) and symbols      
+   are identified by starting them with "&&C1" as in the example below;        
+

+   Like the^COPYELM+command, only to invoke the Edit Compare to compare the    
+   current element to another element or another location.                     
+   Note: This version is only supported in QuickEdit.                          
+                                                                               
^*Filter By Backout Status                                                      
+   The^Apply Filter+option is enhanced to allow filtering the element          
+   selection list to only include backed out elements.                         
+                                                                               
^*Alter Endevor Meta-data                                                       
+   The^UA+(User Alter) user routine can now update the Element metadata        
+   so long as Endevor V17 (or later) is installed, SMF logging is active,      
+   and the user has security access to the^Alter+action at this location.      
+   Fields that can be updated include; the^Description,+the^Processor Group,   
+   the^Singout-UserID,+the^Generate, Retireve,+and^LastAction CCIDs+and,       
+   the^UserData+field (like the^UD+line command/User Routine).                 
+                                                                               
^*Generate && Retrieve CCIDs                                                    
+   Now the Element^Generate+and^Retrive CCIDs+are available in addition        
+   to the^Last Action CCID+in the Element selection list.                      
+   They are distributed with a default length of zero to hide them, but        
+   you can use^ECols+to adjust their column width and position.                
+                                                                               
^*WideScreen support for Shipment Display                                       
+   The Shipment Display (C1SP9300/C1SP9301) are updated to support WideScreen. 
+   Hint: Remeber to use^ECols RESET,+to change column width/order or           
+  ^Ecols Off+to return to default display.                                     
+                                                                               
^*CustomerName and SiteID                                                       
+   The^CUNAME+and^SITEID+from the defaults table are now visible in the        
+   LongName primary Help screen after the first successful Endevor request.    
+   Just press^PF1+to see them. Note: if CUNAME is shown as UNKNOWN please      
+   contact your Endevor Administrator as it means there was a problem loading  
+   the defaults table.                                                         
+                                                                               
^*Support for ASCII files                                                       
+   The^EA+(Edit ASCII) command can be used to edit^ASCII+files stored in       
+   Endevor.  When using^EA+elements are retrieved to a temporary PATH and      
+   the editor is invoked with the ASCII option.  When the file is saved        
+   it is re-added to Endevor (from the temp location).                         
+                                                                               
^*Modify User Data                                                              
+   The^UD+(User Data) user routine can now update the Element user data        
+   so long as Endevor V17 (or later) is installed, SMF logging is active,      
+   and the user has security access to the^Alter+action.                       
+                                                                               
^*Extra Date and Time Fields                                                    
+   LongName now defaults to showing the^Last Action Date+and^Time+on the       
+   element selection list. However, other date and time fields are also        
+   available and can be 'un-hidden' by setting a non-zero column width         
+   through the^ECols+command. In addition to the^Last Action Date/Time         
+   available fields include:^Update, Move, Generate, and Package+timestamps.   
+   Note: Use the^ECols, RESET+sub-command to reset to your sites defaults.     
+                                                                               
^*Unique Element Actions                                                        
+   If only a single element matches the selection criteria, AND a valid        
+   line command is entered on the primary screen, that command is actioned     
+   as if it had been entered on the single row.  This allows quick access to   
+   Edit, or Generate etc. After the action the row is updated with the status  
+   and further commands can be entered normally.                               
+                                                                               
^*Element In Use                                                                
+   The LongName utility will now check if anybody is already editing an        
+   element before allowing an Edit action and if it's being used by another    
+   user a message will be returned.  Likewise if a QuickEdit user attempts     
+   to edit an element that is open in LongName they will get the same warning. 
+                                                                               
^*Package Information && Backout Status                                         
+   Now the Element Package information^(Source Package, Output Package,        
+  ^date, and backout status)+are available in the Element selection list.      
+   They are distributed with a default length of zero to hide them, but        
+   you can use^ECols+to adjust their column width and position.                
+   Additionally these variables are available in the initial macro when an     
+   Edit session is invoked (LNAMIMAC) so you can add custom messaging.         
+                                                                               
^*Variable Record Length Support                                                
+   You can now customize a table providing the^Record length, BlockSize+and    
+  ^record format+on a type by type basis for any type that does not use the    
+   default FB80 format.  Edit the header block in the LONGNAME rexx to match   
+   your site's specific requirements.                                          
+   as per sample below;                                                        
+

+       "JAVA      NATURAL  OTHER     CSV         CSVG"                         
+      ^Non_80byte_Lengths+=,                                                   
+       "600/27998 90/27990 100/27900 32004/32008 32004/32008"                  
+      ^Non_80byte_Recfms+=,                                                    
+       "VB        FB       FB        VB          VB"                           
+                                                                               
+                                                                               
^*Edit Fail Prompt                                                              
+   Now if, after editing or creating an element, the Add/Update action failes, 
+   after reviewing the messages, you will be returned to Edit mode where if    
+   you can't resolve the problem (e.g. supply a valid CCID or Comment) you     
+   will have the chance to save your work.                                     
^   Note:+Options to change the CCID, Comment, or Override signout are          
+   available from the action bar, under the Edit item.                         
+                                                                               
^*New Sample IMACRO on Edit                                                     
+   When Long-Name is used to Create or Edit an element, an initial edit macro; 
^   LONGIMAC+is invoked.  Sites can tailor this macro to provide their own      
+   custom setup logic, for example selecting Edit profiles, Hilite, etc.       
+                                                                               
^*Action Request Mode                                                           
+   After requesting any action you are prompted to either^Submit+the request   
+   to batch,^Edit+the request SCL, or^Append+this request to a queue to be     
+   processed later.  In addition, if foreground processing is active you       
+   can request your actions to be processed in^F/G.+                           
+                                                                               
+   You can also set the^Enable AUTO processing+option to 'Y' to allow your     
+   current choice to be automatically applied to the next request, so if       
+   you set the processing mode to F/G, all actions are attempted in F/G        
+   without prompting you (unless an error occurs which resets the flag).       
+   If you set the option to Auto/Append but don't remember to use the^SUB      
+   primary command, you will be prompted on exit.                              
+                                                                               
^*EFind Primary Command                                                         
+   Allow you to^Search+any Endevor table view, filtering lines that do not     
+   contain the requested string.                                               
+   Entering^EFind+without any operands,^Restores+the previous contents.        
+                                                                               
^*Edit/Sub Primary Commands                                                     
+   You can now use^EDIT+or^SUB+Primary commands to submit any pending          
+   requests to be processed (including requesting them to be processed in F/G.)
+   These commands also reset the^Auto Processing+option to 'N'.                
+                                                                               
^*Refresh Primary Command                                                       
+   You can now use^REFRESH+Primary command to re-build the element selection   
+   list.  This will NOT clear any pending batch requests, but will allow       
+   updates from batch (or other) requests to be seen.                          
+                                                                               
^*Difference Line Commands                                                      
+   You can select any two elements marking them with^D+to invoke a SuperC      
+   side-by-side compare.  Additionally you can use^D1+or^DN+to Explicitly

+   From the ActionBar,^Settings, Difference...+you can now control the SuperC  
+   process and statement options, for example to select Wide or LongLine       
+   support, or to change the Compare Columns.                                  
+                                                                               
^*List Filters                                                                  
+   List filters are now enabled to allow you to limit/filter elements that     
+   only match the CCID/Userid, or Processor Group you require.                 
+   Are there other filters you'd like to use?  Please let me know...           
+                                                                               
^*Multiple Element Name Masks                                                   
+   You are no longer restricted to entering a Single element name when         
+   starting the utility, simply enter multiple names or patterns separated     
+   by comma - for example;^B%AT*,THIS*+to show elements matching               
+   either pattern.                                                             
+                                                                               
^*Summary of Levels                                                             
+   The Summary of levels display is enhanced to now support^CCID+and^Comment   
+   for each version level in addition to the Stmts, inserts, Deletes and Sync  
+   counts and flags.  This panel also supports the WideScreen enhancement to   
+   allow you to to scroll left/right and/or change your column prefrences      
+   using the ECols primary command or Settings Action Bar item.                
+                                                                               
^*Extra Fields on Element Selection List                                        
+   When you drive an Element Selection list, additional fields, not visible    
+   in QuickEdit are available for each row.  For example the^Date+and^Time+    
+   of last update, The^CCID+and^Comment+of the last action.  For elements with 
+   Long Names, the internal or short name (often called CONGNAME) is available 
+   in the field^EleShort+and any^UserData+that has been saved using an exit    
+   or the new ALTER statement in v17 will be visible.  That said, whether any  
+   of these fields will be visible is controlled on a per-user basis using the 
+  ^ECols+command by setting that columns width to a non-zero value.  If there  
+   is too much data to fit comfortably on one screen, use the^LEFT/RIGHT+      
+   commands to access the^primary/alternate+element list views. Finally if you 
+   need to see more data than will fit in your current physical screen you can 
+   enable Wrapping, which allows each row to use TWO lines of output.  Use the 
+   command^ECols WrapON|WrapPri|WrapAlt|WrapOff+to control this option.        
+                                                                               
^*Submit History                                                                
+   Now when you submit a job for batch processing the 'Red' message is         
+   captured and displayed in a short message.  The long message, press^PF1,    
+   will show a table of recently submitted jobs, and can also be accessed      
+   from the Action bar,^Endevor, SubmittedJobs...                              
+                                                                               
^*Submit Symbols                                                                
+   Now when you submit a job for batch you have the option of including        
+   Long-Name symbols in the job card(s) and having them expanded when you      
+   submit the job.  Expansion is controled by an option (Y/N) and symbols      
+   are identified by starting them with "&&" as in the example below;          
+

+   We liked this option so much, we doubled the number of job cards you can    
+   supply, so now you can create your own flower boxes with details of the     
+   submitted job so it's easier than ever to keep track of what each job is    
+   doing.  To see all the available symbols, just issue UX beside any element. 
+                                                                               
^*Save/Forget Element Name                                                      
+   You can now control whether Long-Name 'remembers' the long element name(s)  
+   from the Settings ActionBar item.  Additionally there is an option to       
+   control whether the element name(s) are upper-cased on entry.  This option  
+   is also available on the transfer request screen, Option^T,+to allow        
+   easy 'renaming' of mixed to upper case element names or vice-versa.         
+                                                                               
^*User Commands                                                                 
+   Long-Name supports^User Extensions+in the form of User supplied Rexx Execs  
+   or Clists.  When Long-Name encounters a line command starting with 'U' it   
+   appends that command to the string 'UsrRtn' and attempts to pass control    
+   to that command(UsrRtnUx) using the select service.  All the details of     
+   the current command, row, and table variables are passed via the shared     
+   pool, with the variable names passed as a string in the Parm.  Review the   
+   sample routines UsrRtnU, UsrRtnUX,... for ideas and build your own.         
+   The Difference commands were built using this mechanism as a demonstration  
+   (see UsrRtnD*), but other uses might include^"Deploy for Test",+or          
+  ^"Compile for Debugger"+or any other action that you can imagine against     
+   one or more elements from the list.
