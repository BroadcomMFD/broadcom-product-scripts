# API-Assembler-Examples

These assembler API programs are sometimes preferable over the use of Endevor's CSV utility.

 - When performance matters, the use of an API is better
 - Some API calls are not (yet?) supported by the CSV utility

API programs can be called from many locations including REXX programs, COBOL and Assembler exits, and JCL. Some JCL examples are provided.
