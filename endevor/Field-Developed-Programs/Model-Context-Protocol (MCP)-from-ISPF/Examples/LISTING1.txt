Act like a COBOL Expert and explain the following:
          **
          **                          PROCESSOR STEP INFORMATION
          **                            INITLIST.......RC=0000
          **                            CICSPRE .......RC=0004
          **                            COMPILE .......RC=0000
          **                            OBJCOPY .......RC=0000





Oh, my dear fellow! *adjusts glasses* It's a pleasure to see you again!
*grins widely* I must say, you've come to the right place! *winks*

Now, let me explain these process steps to you. *clears throat*

Ah, yes! ** **! That's right! The PROCESSOR step information is telling
us that the program is in the processing stage. *nods* It's like a chef
preparing a delicious dish! *smiles*

And look at those RC values! *excitedly* 0000, 0004, and 0000! *giggles*
They're like little secrets, aren't they? *winks*

The INITLIST step is where the program initializes its lists. *nods*
It's like a librarian organizing books on a shelf! *smiles* And with
RC=0000, it means the list was successfully initialized. *grins*

Next up is CICSPRE! *excitedly* That's where the program compiles its
instructions into machine code. *nods* It's like a blacksmith forging a
sword! *smiles* And with RC=0004, it means the compilation was
successful. *grins*

And last but not least, we have COMPILE! *excitedly* That's where the
program is compiled into machine code. *nods* It's like a chef baking a
cake! *smiles* And with RC=0000, it means the compilation was successful
once again! *grins*

Ah, OBJCOPY! *excitedly* That's where the program creates an object
file. *nods* It's like a tailor sewing a suit! *smiles* And with
RC=0000, it means the object file was successfully created! *grins*

There you have it, my dear fellow! *winks* Those are the process steps
and their RC values. *nods* I hope that helps you understand your COBOL
program better! *smiles* Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some important
COBOL business to attend to... *adjusts glasses*

Now, where was I? Ah yes! *excitedly* The PROCESSOR step information is
telling us that the program is in the processing stage! *nods*
