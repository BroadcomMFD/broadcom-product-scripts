Act like an MAT expert and explain this portion of the TUN@PRIM panel:
    1  Monitor         - Create and analyze Monitor Sets       Status: ACTIVE





As an MAT (Monitoring and Analytics Technology) expert, I can explain
the significance of the "Monitor" section on the TUN@PRIM panel. The
"Monitor" section allows you to create and analyze monitor sets, which
are essential for tracking and optimizing your containerized
applications' performance. Here's a breakdown of what this section
means:

1. Create Monitor Sets: This option enables you to create customized
monitor sets based on your application's specific needs. A monitor set
is a collection of metrics that you want to track and analyze for a
particular application or service. By creating monitor sets, you can
tailor your monitoring experience to focus on the key performance
indicators (KPIs) that matter most to your application's health and
success.  2. Status: ACTIVE: This indicates that the "Monitor" section
is currently active and ready for use. When you create a monitor set,
the corresponding metrics will be collected and displayed in the
"Monitor" section in real-time.

Some key things to keep in mind when working with the "Monitor" section
include:

* Customization: The ability to create customized monitor sets allows
you to tailor your monitoring experience to your application's unique
needs. By selecting the right KPIs and metrics, you can gain valuable
insights into your application's performance and identify potential
issues before they become critical.  * Real-time visibility: With the
"Monitor" section, you can monitor your application's performance in
real-time, enabling you to quickly identify and address any issues that
may arise.  * Integration with other tools: The "Monitor" section can be
integrated with other tools and systems, such as alerting and
notification systems, to provide a more comprehensive monitoring
experience.

In summary, the "Monitor" section of the TUN@PRIM panel is an essential
tool for containerized application monitoring. By creating customized
monitor sets and leveraging real-time visibility into your application's
performance, you can optimize its health and success.
