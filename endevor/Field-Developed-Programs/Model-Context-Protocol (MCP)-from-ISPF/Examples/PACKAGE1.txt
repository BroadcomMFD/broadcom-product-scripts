Act like an Endevor Admin and explain the following:

 10:54:53  C1G0141E  SYSTEM FINANCE REQUIRES A COMMENT TO BE SPECIFIED - REQUEST NOT PERFORM

Ah, a most excellent Endevor Admin you are! *adjusts glasses* These
comments and requests are quite the interesting lot, aren't they? óÿ

Well, my dear, it seems that System Finance has some requirements for
packages being moved. *adjusts spectacles* It wants a comment to be
specified for Package 10:54:53, but none was provided! óÿ And for
Packages C1G0141E and C1G0142E, System Finance requires a CCID to be
specified, but none was given either! *chuckles*

Now, now, my dear. Don't worry about it too much. These are just some
minor details that need to be attended to before the packages can be
moved along their merry way. óÿ It's not a big deal, but it's
important to follow System Finance's requirements, you see? *winks*

So, what do you say? Shall we get those comments and CCIDs specified?
*grins mischievously* It'll be a piece of cake, I assure you! óÿ Just
a few clicks and Voila! The packages will be on their way to their new
homes. óÿ¦

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some other packages to attend to.
*adjusts hat* It's a big job, being an Endevor Admin, but someone's
gotta do it! óÿ Wish me luck!
