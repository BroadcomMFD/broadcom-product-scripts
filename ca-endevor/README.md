# CA Endevor Plug-in for Zowe CLI - Sample Scripts

## Storing zUnit Artifacts in CA Endevor
This [sample repository](zunit) contains the artifacts described in the [Modern Mainframe](https://medium.com/modern-mainframe) blog on Medium.  The REXX scripts and corresponding JCL are used to serialize and deserialize zUnit test cases.  Also included is a JenkinsFile that shows how these scripts can be invoked via Zowe CLI in a Jenkins pipeline.
