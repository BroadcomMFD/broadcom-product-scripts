# CA Endevor Plug-in for Zowe CLI - Sample Scripts

## Storing zUnit Artifacts in CA Endevor
This [sample repository](zunit) contains the artifacts described in the [Modern Mainframe](https://medium.com/modern-mainframe) blog on Medium.  The REXX scripts and corresponding JCL are used to serialize and deserialize zUnit test cases.  Also included is a JenkinsFile that shows how these scripts can be invoked via Zowe CLI in a Jenkins pipeline.

## CA Gen DevOps Whitepaper sample code and SCL
This [sample repository](ca-gen-whitepaper-sample) contains the artifacts described in the [Building a z/OS CICS Blockmode Application with CA EndevorÂ® and Zowe whitepaper](https://community.broadcom.com/mainframesoftware/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?GroupId=1513&MessageKey=7a3ba595-6432-48aa-93f4-f18206875d72&CommunityKey=4182c217-4789-4997-8f22-87de25983f6e&tab=digestviewer). There are Python scripts that you can use as-is or modify to better match your organization's DevOps practices. Also included are SCL templates (or skeletons) that show examples of processors you will need to have present in your organization's CA Endevor installation to successfully compile and link your CA Gen applications with CA Endevor.
